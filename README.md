# **What Is TypeScript:**
Instead of being creative, let me quote from the official [TypeScript website](https://www.typescriptlang.org/):

**Starts and ends with JavaScript:**
TypeScript starts from the same syntax and semantics that millions of JavaScript developers know today. Use existing JavaScript code, incorporate popular JavaScript libraries, and call TypeScript code from JavaScript.
TypeScript compiles to clean, simple JavaScript code which runs on any browser, in Node.js, or in any JavaScript engine that supports ECMAScript 3 (or newer).
**Strong tools for large apps:**
Types enable JavaScript developers to use highly-productive development tools and practices like static checking and code refactoring when developing JavaScript applications.
Types are optional, and type inference allows a few type annotations to make a big difference to the static verification of your code. Types let you define interfaces between software components and gain insights into the behavior of existing JavaScript libraries.  
**State of the art JavaScript:**
TypeScript offers support for the latest and evolving JavaScript features, including those from ECMAScript 2015 and future proposals, like async functions and decorators, to help build robust components.
These features are available at development time for high-confidence app development, but are compiled into simple JavaScript that targets ECMAScript 3 (or newer) environments.


## **Installing TypeScript:**
1. Go to your command prompt, for windows: cmd
1. **npm install -g typescript** (You need nodeJS installed in the system for this)

## **Compiling TypeScript:**
1. **Create a file with .ts extension**
1. **Write TypeScript code in it**

1. **Type tsc filename.ts in the command prompt**
![compiling typescript](https://github.com/Anondo/tolerable-js/blob/master/img/compile.png)<br>
This should create a plain **filename.js** file which you can run like any other JS code. After all, it is JS code!

Thats it, you are ready to go!
